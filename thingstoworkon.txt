1. combine github and slack posts into single handler that "dumps" message to both
2. change RepoData to make more sense with new format. Associate repo with all job configurations like in config.go?
3. update to use the prowapi for job configuration
4. abstract configuration out of code and into config files. JSON? YAML?
